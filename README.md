# `wlroots-kbdd`

A RaspberryPi-specific wlroots interception library to enable
keyboard layout reporting and switching via DBus commands.
Currently supported compositors include only labwc.

## Install
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libwayland-server-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
    libwlroots-0.18-dev libglib-2.0-dev libgio-2.0-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/avarvit/wlroots-kbdd
$ cd wlroots-kbdd
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
$ env LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/build/libwlroots-kbdd-0.18.so labwc
```
Note: there is no need to install anything under `/usr`. The library
will run from its build directory. Of course, you may move or install
it wherever you please.

## Background and motivation
Wayland uses the xkbcommon library to represent keyboad setup and
input (e.g., keyboard layouts, keymaps, modifiers, keypresses, etc.). 
Using xkbcommon, multiple keyboard layouts can be supported, using a
key combo (e.g., left-Alt-Shift or left Ctrl-Shift) to switch between
configured layout groups (aka languages). Wayland leaves this task to
compositors (it is not a core protocol feature), so each compositor
has its own way of configuring multiple layouts and the key combo
to switch among them, while all compositors use xkbcommon underneath.

Some compositors also support a per-window keyboard layout group
(aka language) setup, as per the X11 `kbdd` program (hence the name
of this library). This "kbdd" functionality can be either built in
(labwc), or implemented by means of a plugin (wayfire). [Note that
a per-window layout group setup is a *huge* time saver when working
in multiple languages; unfortunately, today's desktop environments,
probably influenced by mobile device virtual keyboards, rarely
acknowledge this need...].

What is missing, then? Answer, two good-old X11 features, namely:
(a) an indication of the current layout group (language) so that
the user can see what language they are typing in (instead of having
to type and delete, if the wrong language is switched in) and
(less crucial, but still useful) (b) a point-and-click method for
switching between layout groups, e.g. in a taskbar widget.

## What does `wlroots-kbdd` do?
`wlroots-kbdd` uses DBus to send and receive messages about keyboard
layout changes. By sending appropriate DBus messages when it detects
a layout change (either because the user changed the current layout
group via the key combo, or because they focused in a different window,
thus causing a layout group change), `wlroots-kbdd` sends the current
layout name to a widget that displays it in the taskbar. And, by
receiving appropriate DBus messages from that same widget,
`wlroots-kbdd` can switch the keyboard layout of the currently
focused-in window.

## History
The history behind `wlroots-kbdd` is related to `wf-panel-pi`, a
derivative of `wf-shell`, a Wayland shell that implements a taskbar
with various utility widgets. As its name and origin suggest,
`wf-shell` is part of the `wayfire` compositor add-ons; the
Raspberry PI UI experts have ported it into a RPI-specific
panel, to be used with both `wayfire` and, more recently, `labwc`.

`wf-panel-pi` accepts commands via DBus, addressed to
`org.wayfire.wfpanel`. Commands take the form `command <widget>
<argument>`, directing the "command" to widget `<widget>`
and passing it the argument `<argument>`. This is used among others
to drive bundled `wf-panel-pi` widgets, such as a volume control
widget, into actions, such as mute, volume up/down etc.

The `kbdlayout` plugin, after having received a list of layouts as
above, and upon a click, displays a menu of layout short names, and,
when the user clicks on one of these, sends back to the compositor
(at DBus address `org.wayfire.kbdd.layout`) a `switch` command,
having as an argument the layout name the user clicked on. This is
intended to instruct the compositor to swithch the keyboard layout
of the currently configured (toplevel) window to the one sent over
DBus. Additionally, `kbdlayout` can send to the compositor an
`enable` command with a zero or non-zero argument to request that
the overall functionality be turned off or on, respectively.

## Caveats
`wlroots-kbdd` works by intercepting some wlroots calls. Interception
works using the LD_PRELOAD mechanism to preload this library before
the wlroots shared library. This means that if the wlroots libary is
statically linked in the compositor library, wlroots-kbdd will not
work. It may also fail if the compositor is setuid-root.

Note that `wlroots-kbdd` removes itself from the LD_PRELOAD path and,
if LD_PRELOAD only contains the `wlroots-kbdd` library, it deletes
the LD_PRELOAD variable from the environment of the compositor. This
is done early enough in the initialization of the compositor, so that
no other programs spawned by the compositor are affected by the
LD_PRELOAD setting.

In this current version, if a shutdown is initiated while a DBus
message is sent and before a few milliseconds (the timeout), the
shotdown may hung for 90 seconds waiting for the DBus session to
terminate. This is not serious, the system eventually shuts down
and no harm is done.

## Debug logging
`wlroots-kbdd` will log debug information if the environment
variable `DEBUG_WLROOTS_KBDD` is set. If the variable is set
to a path under `/tmp`, its value will be taken as the name
of the debug file (for security reasons, it is required to be
under `/tmp`, if not, the path is ignored). If no path is given
or if an erroneous path is given, or the file cannot be opened
for output, `wlroots-kbdd` will log to `stderr` instead.
Example use:
```
$ env LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/build/libwlroots-kbdd-0.18.so DEBUG_WLROOTS_KBDD=/tmp/wlr_kbdd-debug.txt labwc
```
will output debug logging information in `/tmp/wlr_kbdd-debug.txt`.
Note that no strict security checks are performed (e.g., it is not
checked whether the debug file already exists and/or is a symbolic
link), so please take your precautions so as not to overwrite any
precious files.

## Security
`wlroots-kbdd` is not intended to provide a bullet-proof channel for
handling keyboard layouts. Any process that can write to DBus can
fool either `wlroots-kbdd` to switch layouts or turn it off/on, or
misguide the `kbdlayout` plugin into displaying wrong info about
the the available and the current layout(s). However, `wrloots-kbdd`
does not introduce any methods that could be used for e.g. keyboard
hijacking and/or stealing keypresses etc. In that sense, no essential
loss of security is introduced by using `wlroots-kbdd`.

## References
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols/-/merge_requests/31
contains a discussion about implementing "keybind" wlroots protocol (the
PR was rejected).

Some compositors, like sway, have special IPC messages to handle this task
(Googling will return meaningful results).

`wlroots-kbdd` will not work for Wayfire. For Wayfire, I have built a
plugin (based on Alex Jake Green's `wayfire-kbdd-plugin`) that can be
